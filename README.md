Gaussian Mixture Model

This code implement Gaussian Mixture Models, a statistical clustering model.
* Input: 20-news-groups processed documents, with each document is represented by a list of its words.
* Output: Cluster them into different groups.
* Ideas: Suppose each document is a multivariate random variable generated from a random process. Decode that process, we will find the way to group them. The details of this method is describe in file document.pdf
